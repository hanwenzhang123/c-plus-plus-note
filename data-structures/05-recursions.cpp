//mathematical induction overview
mathematical induction is a technique to prove universal statements:
"P(n) is true for any natural number n"
 
there are 2 steps un such proofs:
1. base case: we prove that P(1) is true
2. inductive step: we know that for any n>=2, p(n-1) -> p(n)
(that is we assume that P(n-1) is true, and under this assumption, we know that P(n) is true)
  
We proved:  Conclusion:
P(1)             P(1)
P(1)->P(2)       P(2)
P(2)->P(3)       P(3)
P(3)->P(4)       P(4)

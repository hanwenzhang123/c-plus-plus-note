A single line comment will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes "//" preceding it:

// Prints "hi!" to the terminal
std::cout << "hi!";

You can also use a single line comment after a line of code:

std::cout << "hi!";  // Prints "hi!"


A multi-line comment will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with "/*" to begin the comment, and "*/" to end the comment:

/* This is all commented.
std::cout << "hi!";
None of this is going to run! */

C++ is a general-purpose coding language.
C++ runs line by line, from top to bottom.
C++ is a case-sensitive language. 
std::cout is how you output to the terminal:

#include <iostream> //include libraries - iostream contains code that allows for input and output, such as displaying data in the terminal window or reading input from your keyboard.

int main() //the main() function
{         //beginning of the function
  
  std::cout << "Codecademy\n";    //what the program does
  
}        //end of the function

std::cout is the “character output stream”. It is pronounced “see-out”.
<< is an operator that comes right after it.
"Hello World!\n" is what’s being outputted here. You need double quotes around text. The \n is a special character that indicates a new line.
; is a punctuation that tells the computer that you are at the end of a statement. It is similar to a period in a sentence.

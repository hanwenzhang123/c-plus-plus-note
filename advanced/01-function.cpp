definite: let n and k be two nonnegative integers, such that k <= n.
  we define k-combinations as the number of unordered selections of k distinct elements from the set of size n.
  k-combinatiins is denoted by (nk) and is also called n choose k
  n=5 K=3
  
  theorem: let n and k be two nonnegative integers, such that k<=n.
